Figured I challenge myself and make it all C99.

Open Empires is a from-scratch rewrite of the Age of Empires 2 engine. It's portable across operating systems as SDL2 is the only dependency. The networking engine supports 1-8 players multiplayer over TCP. There's no AI, scenarios, or campaigns, or anything that facilitates a \_single player\_ experience of the sort. This is a beat-your-friends-up experience that I've wanted since I was a little kid.

I plan to have an MVP of sorts with 4 civilizations and some small but balanced unit / tech tree sometime in April this year. Here's a 2 player over TCP screenshot with a 1000 something units and 100ms networking latency:

I was getting 30 FPS running two clients on my x230 laptop. I simulate latency and packet drops on localhost with \`tc qdisc netm\`.

I don‚Äôt think C gets enough credit. Sure, C doesn‚Äôt love you. C isn‚Äôt about love‚ÄìC is about thrills. C hangs around in the bad part of town. C knows all the gang signs. C has a motorcycle, and wears the leathers everywhere, and never wears a helmet, because that would mess up C‚Äôs punked-out hair. C likes to give cops the finger and grin and speed away. Mention that you‚Äôd like something, and C will pretend to ignore you; the next day, C will bring you one, no questions asked, and toss it to you with a you-know-you-want-me smirk that makes your heart race. Where did C get it? ‚ÄúIt fell off a truck,‚Äù C says, putting away the boltcutters. You start to feel like C doesn‚Äôt know the meaning of ‚Äúprivate‚Äù or ‚Äúprotected‚Äù: what C wants, C takes. This excites you. C knows how to get you anything but safety. C will give you anything but commitment

In the end, you‚Äôll leave C, not because you want something better, but because you can‚Äôt handle the intensity. C says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse,‚Äù but you know that C can never die, not so long as C is still the fastest thing on the road.""",2017-03-15 06:45:15,2017,3,0.0931818181818182,Good,Not Nuetral

&#x200B;

IKOS is a sound static analyzer for C and C++ based on LLVM, developed at NASA.

Here, **sound** means that it is mathematically correct and cannot miss a bug, thanks to the theory of Abstract Interpretation. The counterpart is that it might produce false positives. It is similar to Polyspace, Astr√©e or Frama-C (its value analysis).

&#x200B;

IKOS checks for a lot of undefined behaviors, such as buffer overflows, divisions by zero and so on. The full list is available [here](https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/ikos/blob/master/analyzer/README.md#checks). The list is somewhat similar to UBSan checks. You can also use IKOS to prove arbitrary conditions using `__ikos_assert(condition)`.

&#x200B;

IKOS was designed to target embedded systems written in C, and that's where it really shines.

&#x200B;

Feel free to report bugs on Github. Feedback is also welcome on the mailing list: [ikos@lists.nasa.gov](mailto:ikos@lists.nasa.gov)",2018-12-12 11:39:26,2018,12,0.09722222222222222,Good,Not Nuetral

53,The creation of a game from scratch on a live stream,ckath6,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/ckath6/the_creation_of_a_game_from_scratch_on_a_live/,"Hello everybody!

A little background: after 3.5 years developing a single game (my first commercial game) and releasing it to the PC and PS4, I realized I didn't actually *know* programming. I started off by just visually connecting nodes in Unreal and by the time the game demanded some C++ to integrate the console SDKs with the FMOD middleware and all sorts of crazy stuff, I desperately searched the internet, asked a ton of people and tried-and-error'ed my way into release. I decided to take a step back and learn programming for real.

I learned C and C++, game engine programming, low level and high level code. I really fell in love with it.

Professionally, I had an opportunity and ended up leaving the indie games industry; so I could do whatever project I wanted in my free time, no need to earn money with that.

Since I was really enjoying writing games from scratch, I decided to focus on that. After a couple of games (and inspired by other programming live streams) I decided to make an entire game, in C, from scratch, on a live stream.

It's been a great experience, although it is pretty hard and there is a certain pressure do to everything as fast as I can, to get tangible results. But that is a valuable skill to learn. I'm also improving my English skills, and my attention skills (I have two seconds to glance at chat to see if there is anything there while the program compiles, all the while not forgetting what I am doing).

The game is coming along pretty nicely. As of this writing, I have live streamed 16 times, and they last anywhere from 2.5h to 4h.

Here is the progress of the game:

&#x200B;

[The progress of 16 live streams](https://reddit.com/link/ckath6/video/rojfasmy0od31/player)

The idea was to start with a simple Breakout clone, but expand on the gameplay idea: what if all other arcade games were based on Breakout?

&#x200B;

You can watch the whole development process, learning not only the actual programming to get the game going starting off with a blank files and no libraries, but also some of the design decisions and the experimentation with the failed ideas (there were already a few).

Here is the link to my Youtube channel for you to watch the live streams:

[https://www.youtube.com/DanZaidan](https://www.youtube.com/DanZaidan)

For the people short on time, I have created a Highlights video showing the main moments of the first few live streams:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKWrGbSBZ\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKWrGbSBZ_8)

The game (and its entire source code) is available for free on itchio: [danzaidan.itch.io](https://danzaidan.itch.io/)

&#x200B;

I hope you find this interesting.

Let me know if you enjoyed it, or have any questions.

Thanks,

This was really interesting as I had to go through steps of building: 


a token scanner, with flex;


a parser, writing out my grammar in bison;


an abstract syntax tree, generated as code was parsed;

and finally the interpreter itself, which ran through the AST using a stack to evaluate blocks.

It's an amazing feeling to see the ""made up code"" and to understand the exact process by which it is interpreted to become a real program.

61,"This sub would be a lot more interesting without all the ""Do my Intro To Programming homework for me"" posts",9xvvpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/9xvvpf/this_sub_would_be_a_lot_more_interesting_without/,"The vast majority of posts on this sub are either people asking absolute beginner-level C questions that could be answered by just reading about the language for less than an hour; or much more annoyingly, literally posting a picture of their homework sheet and basically saying ""do this for me"". These posts get downvoted but there's so many of them compared to the slower rate of C news and discussion that interesting posts don't stay at the top spots.

To prove my point, look at the difference between the front pages of two subreddits right now:

/r/python's ""hottest"" 4 posts right now:

* News about python updates in Red Hat

* Pentesting framework written in python

* Python data visualisation

* Python tool for making gif animations of maze-solving algorithms

/r/C_Programming has:

* Post asking people to explain basic integer overflow

* The same question reposted by the same person

* Question about the length of an array

* Question about argc and argv

Not too bad, but those are the posts that made it to the top. The bottom 2/3 of the page is posts with titles like ""Help"" all basically saying ""My code doesn't work. Fix it.""

I'm not saying that it should be forbidden to ask questions, but I think the sub would be a lot more lively if either:

* Completely beginner questions were redirected to a dedicated subreddit like /r/cpp_questions. The sub /r/c_questions has been abandoned for over 5 years so would probably be easy to claim from the reddit admins

62,I wrote a full-featured file manager with awesome performance in C,edpnf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/edpnf6/i_wrote_a_fullfeatured_file_manager_with_awesome/,"GitHub project page: https://github.com/jarun/nnn

When I started, the goal was to write a reasonably featured (but performant) file manager for a Pi used as a media player. Over the course of time I developed `nnn`. Besides being a file manager, it is also a du analyzer, an app launcher, a batch renamer and a file picker. It also comes with tons of plugins.

`nnn` runs smoothly on the Raspberry Pi, Termux on Android, Linux, macOS, BSD, Cygwin, WSL and works seamlessly with DEs and GUI utilities.

I have been developing it alone for about 2.5 yrs. And now we have an efficient small team. So if you have any feature requests or suggestions, we are happy to listen.

Don't forget to visit the project wiki! It has a lot of information on central concepts, program usage, how-tos and troubleshooting.",2019-12-22 04:59:18,2019,12,0.22142857142857145,Good,Not Nuetral

75,I wrote a minimal POSIX-compliant sleep utility that can fit on a QR code,l4wfoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/l4wfoo/i_wrote_a_minimal_posixcompliant_sleep_utility/,"[https://github.com/Virv12/sleep/](https://github.com/Virv12/sleep/)

I developed a minimal, POSIX-compliant (I think), sleep utility.

This uses only 1160B which is only 3.0% of the size of GNU sleep.

To achieve such size I disabled the C standard libraries and replaced those with a simpler [boot.s](https://github.com/Virv12/sleep/blob/master/boot.s) written in assembly, all compiled with this command `gcc -nostartfiles -static -Os -nodefaultlibs -nostdlib -no-canonical-prefixes -s -o sleep boot.s sleep.c -flto -Xlinker -n -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Qn -std=c18 -Xlinker -gc-sections`.

Fun fact: as said in the title you can put the entire binary in a QR code since those can store 2953 bytes.

Your opinion is highly appreciated.

I started writing C in 1985 while employed by a small software company.  Over the next 20 years, I wrote about a million lines of C that ran on various flavors of UNIX, mostly business applications, device controllers, data exchange software and the like.  My software is still used by thousands of businesses.

I switched careers about 2006.  My current career choice has been crushed by COVID-19, so I'm looking at getting back to C development.  I have maintained my C fluency through the years with projects on my personal UNIX and Linux machines.

Any suggestions about the type of company and projects that might be interested in a person of my skills?

I thought C would be a nightmare, coming from higher level languages like Java and C#, but I'm loving it. I love the ""I'm C and I do it the machine way"" type of feel. Like in Java, you didn't need to worry too much about strings. Strings were just... text in quotation marks. But in C, you HAVE to know your strings. You have to know your pointers. I didn't even know about the newline character and the \0 character until I started C programming. What's even more amazing is that you can implement many of the basic functions that K&R made decades ago, like strncpy (and many of them are exercises in K&R too). Programming in C has made me realize the importance of bits, text files, and strings. Best of all I can play around in C in just about any Unix setting. Give me a black and white Unix console and I'll write some C programs in it. Seems like the language doesn't try to coddle you at all, and that has made me feel like a manly programming lumberjack.",2014-10-07 18:41:39,2014,10,0.34487179487179487,Good,Not Nuetral
