1,Can you help me allow my router to accept 💩 as the SSID?,5zcb8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/5zcb8m/can_you_help_me_allow_my_router_to_accept_as_the/,"I have a Xiaomi MI3 router flashed with Padavan (custom open source firmware). When I try to use an emoji or non standard characters in the SSID, a pop-up says: *SSID cannot contain the character ""💩""*

I found what I believe to be the source of the message in *../www/general.js*:

    ...

    function validate_ssidchar(ch) {
    if (ch >= 32 && ch <= 126)
        return true;
    return false;
    }

    function validate_string_ssid(o) {
    var i,c;
    for (i = 0; i < o.value.length; ++i) {
        c = o.value.charCodeAt(i);
        if (!validate_ssidchar(c)) {
            alert(""<#JS_validSSID1#> "" + o.value.charAt(i) + "" <#JS_validSSID2#>"");
            o.value = """";
            o.focus();
            o.select();
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
    }     

    ...

So to my non-javascript eye, it looks like it's checking if the SSID contains characters inside of the acceptable 32-126 ascii range, and denies if not, correct?

What would be the easiest way to get around this check? Can I block this bit using browser console or something?

If the only option is to edit the file and reflash the firmware, what should I change/remove exactly?

-----------------------------------------------------------

Edit: Hahaha why is this pinned as an announcement? 

A lot of people have been asking for a ELI5 (mainly from the /r/bestof thread) so I made a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urH2ofav9us

TLDW;

1. Go to router's admin page 
2. Change SSID to 💩, get error message
2. If on Chrome: Press F12 and click on the Sources tab
3. On the left you should see a list of files with .js extensions.
4. Click on ie. 'general.js', and search (ctrl+f) for 'SSID' or the text that appeared in the pop up that prevented you from using emoji SSID. What we need is something like `function validate_ssidchar` 
6. Click on the console tab, type `validate_ssidchar` (or whatever your router-specific function is), press enter, and see if it complains.
7. Then simply reassign it by typing `window.validate_ssidchar = function () { return true; };`, press enter. 
 (obviously change `validate_ssidchar` to yours.)
8. 💩 should work normally now.

3,Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces,c8drjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/,"hello,

i've been slightly dismayed, that in every tabs-vs-spaces debate i can find on the web, nobody is talking about the accessibility consequences for the visually impaired

let me illustrate with a quick story, why i irrevocably turned from a spaces to tabs guy

- i recently worked at a company that used tabs
- i created a new repository, and thought i was being hip and modern, so i started to evangelize spaces for the 'consistency across environments'
- i get approached by not one, but TWO coworkers who unfortunately are highly visually impaired,  
  and each has a different visual impairment
    - one of them uses tab-width 1 because he uses such a gigantic font-size
    - the other uses tab-width 8 and a really wide monitor
    - these guys have serious problems using codebases with spaces, they have to convert, do their work, and then unconvert before committing
    - these guys are *not* just being fussy — it's almost surprising they can code at all, it's kind of sad to watch but also inspiring
- at that moment, i instantaneously conceded — there's just no counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility needs of valued coworkers
- 'consistency across environments' is exactly the problem for these guys, they have different needs
- just think of how rude and callous it would be to overrule these fellas needs for my precious ""consistency when i post on stack overflow""
- so what would you do, spaces people, if you were in charge? overrule their pleas?

from that moment onward, i couldn't imagine writing code in spaces under the presumption that ""nobody with visual impairment will ever need to work with this code, probably"", it's just a ridiculous way to think, especially in open-source

i'll admit though, it's a pain posting tabs online and it gets bloated out with an unsightly default 8 tab-width — however, can't we see clearly that this is a deficiency with websites like github and stackoverflow and reddit here, where viewers are not easily able to configure their own preferred viewing tab-width? websites and web-apps obviously have the ability to set their own tab width via css, and so ultimately, aren't we all making our codebases worse as a workaround for the deficiencies in these websites we enjoy? why are these code-viewing apps missing basic code-viewing features?

in the tabs-vs-spaces debate, i see people saying ""tabs lets us customize our tab-width"", as though we do this ""for fun"" — but this is about meeting the real needs of real people who have real impairments — how is this not seen as a simple cut-and-dry accessibility issue?

i don't find this argument in online debates, and wanted to post there here out in the blue as a feeler, before i start ranting like this to my next group of coworkers ;)

is there really any reason, in favor of spaces, that counter balances the negative consequences for the visually impaired?

My take aways from this project using a full TypeScript/Javascript Stack!",8n1hy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/8n1hy9/streamed_myself_developing_an_app_in_28_days_to/,"Hi everyone!

I want to preface this post by stating that I am in no way trying to self promote something I have made. While I think it would be awesome for people here to check it out and use it, I wanted to post about my experience with creating an application in 28 days and hopefully motivate someone else to do the same.

### About SimpleAlerts
As the title states, I streamed the entirety of my work for this project on Twitch. I have always been enthralled with the concept of Twitch and I really thought it could be an incredible place for programmers to showcase their work. This led me to start a stream that would encourage people to get involved with programming. I have almost three years of experience working with web development, mobile development, and I am mainly self taught. I still have much to learn and I believe the best way of doing that is through projects. This is where the format for my stream comes- start a project from start to launch in 28 days. This is how SimpleAlerts was born. SimpleAlerts is an open source project that is here to solve the problem of unreadable, disorganized stream events through Streamlabs. For much more detail on this feel free to head over to [this repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts) as it has much more information about the project.

### Learning Points
As someone who started off his programming career truly through internships and hackathons, I know how intimidating it is to begin your programming journey. This is why I think this style of project is a great way get a deep dive into something that you have been really wanting to try. I wanted to list the benefits I got from this no matter what level programmer you may be:

#### Learning how to properly setup your project beforehand is KEY
This is something I have been really wanting to get into as I have always struggled with it. The way you tackle massive projects/problems all comes down to the initial setup. Take as much time as you need in order to really understand how you will be doing each step of the application. It will save you tons of time in the long run.
#### Keep every task bite sized
I am a huge advocate of Github Issues (as you will see if you check out the [repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts)). It is much easier for me to digest tasks if they are written out in bite sized concepts. I feel this is a practice many people lack. They feel as if they need to tackle huge problems at once. You don’t! Your code will be there tomorrow, I promise :)
#### Use a tech stack you want to learn
It is much easier to do things when you have a drive to do it! I chose Angular 5 / Node / MongoDB as my stack as I wanted to get a better grasp on TypeScript, Promises, and interacting with the MongoDB, Node driver. After finishing SimpleAlerts I feel really good about JavaScript in general and really can't wait to write more promises ;).
#### Set a deadline and be consistent
This take away I think is really important. Many projects that are started are never finished. This could be the shear amount of features that you may want to implement or you’ve simply lost your drive. I had two main motivating factors when building this project. First was the 28 day timeframe and second was the fact that I set a stream schedule 5 days a week for 2-3 hours a day. This kept me engaged with SimpleAlerts.
#### It’s okay to struggle and not be perfect from the beginning
You are going to mess up and do things wrong. That's okay! As you start building more projects things will start to click. This could even lead you to refactor older projects with this new insight!
#### Be proud of your work even if only one person uses it
It’s okay that your application doesn’t pop off-most don’t. Just take a look back at all the time you spent and how much you learned from building out an app from start to launch. These projects are always beneficial even if you don’t make millions of dollars ;)

I wanted to wrap up this post by saying that the programming community is a great one to be a part of. All the people I have interacted with during this project have been more than great. Everyone is willing to help each other out and want to see everyone succeed. If you are afraid to start something like this or even start programming, just remember people are here to support you. One of the reasons why I decided to make SimpleAlerts open source was to encourage beginners to come and add to the codebase. Consider contributing on Github @ [this repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts) if you are interested!

Thanks for taking the time to read this and if you have any questions/concerns please feel free to reach out :)

There have been similar posts to this but I really received a benefit from them and thought I'd echo my experience. Two of these ""interviews"" were online assessments, two were in person, and two were over Skype. The positions I've applied for are mainly at start ups and not for any specified Jr / Mid / Sr level. 

I know that a lot of people disagree with this type of interview, like them or not, in my experience they've been a reality. When you're self-taught and haven't had your first job, I guess you have to prove yourself somehow. An assessment of Github / portfolio links would be a more ideal measure of progress but doesn't seem to count for everything. 

   * Algorithmic*

1. Define a function that returns *n* lines of [Pascal’s Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle). (this question was the entire interview)
2. Define a function that takes an array of strings, and returns the most commonly occurring string that array (this question came with an execution time limit)
3. Use recursion to log a fibonacci sequence of *n* length.

  *Definitional*

4. Explain the use cases for, and differences between — *bind*, *apply* and *call*.
5. Explain event delegation and why it is useful.
6. What is the event loop?
7. How does hoisting work in JavaScript?

    *Discussion*

7. Walk us through the process of creation of an application or website you've built.
8. Which new JavaScript / browser features are you most excited about and why?
9. What are the differences between functional and imperative programming styles, and explain your preference, if any.",2015-11-03 20:32:39,2015,11,0.1710016835016835,Good,Not Nuetral

Many of the positions I interviewed for where using Angular so a bunch of the questions are geared towards that.


**Standard JS Questions:**

* Explain javascript closures
* Explain event bubbling 
* Explain event delegation
* What does apply() do
* What does bind() do
* Explain what the js map function does provide an example
* What is strict mode
* Whats the difference between a promise and a callback

**Angular JS Questions:**

* What is scope
* What is a directive
* What is the link function in the directive
* What is the digest cycle (after I mentioned it in giving another answer) 
* What is $scope.$apply
* What are the most commonly used out of the box directives
* What does transclude do on directives
* Tell me about a time you had problems with state in angular
* Have you ever had performance issues in angular and how did you tackle them
* What do you like about angular, what do you dislike about angular
* Why use a q promise as opposed to just returning $http’s promise
* What does $resource do

**General/Presentation Layer Questions:**

* What is a model in mvc
* Explain css specificity
* How do you centre something horizontally
* Explain what media queries are 
* What are the pros and cons of a single page app
* How could you improve performance of a single page app
* Whats the difference between inline-block and inline
* How would you develop a mobile site for a website that didn’t already have one
* What is jsonp 
* What is a doctype
* On a unix command line how would you run a long command you typed out already an hour ago
* What frontend tools do you normally use
* Where do you think ui’s are heading
* What motivates you, how do you learn

**JS Challenge Type Questions:**

The first few the employer stole from You Can't JavaScript Under Pressure :)

Write a function that takes an integer and returns it doubled

    function doubleInteger(i) {
        //your code here
        
    }    

Write a function that takes a number and returns true if it's even and false if not

    function isNumberEven(i) {
        // i will be an integer. Return true if it's even, and false if it isn't.
    }

Write a function that returns a file extension

    function getFileExtension(i) {
        
        // i will be a string, but it may not have a file extension.
        // return the file extension (with no period) if it has one, otherwise false
        
    }

What will be printed on the console? Why?

    (function() {
       var a = b = 5;
    })();
    console.log(b);

Define a repeatify function on the String object. The function accepts an integer that specifies how many times the string has to be repeated. The function returns the string repeated the number of times specified. 

For example:


    console.log('hello'.repeatify(3));
    //Should print hellohellohello.


What will log out here?

    function test() {
       console.log(a); 
       console.log(foo());
        
       var a = 1;
       function foo() {
          return 2;
       }
    }
    test();


What will log out here?

    var fullname = 'John Doe';
    var obj = {
       fullname: 'Colin Ihrig',
       prop: {
          fullname: 'Aurelio De Rosa',
          getFullname: function() {
             return this.fullname;
          }
       }
    };

    console.log(obj.prop.getFullname()); 
     
    var test = obj.prop.getFullname; 
     
    console.log(test()); 

Fix the previous question’s issue so that the last console.log() prints Aurelio De Rosa.

     .

The following recursive code will cause a stack overflow if the array list is too large. How can you fix this and still retain the recursive pattern?

    var list = readHugeList();
    
    var nextListItem = function() {
        var item = list.pop();
    
        if (item) {
            // process the list item...
            nextListItem();
        }
    };

What will alert out here:

    var a = 'value';
  
    (function() {
      alert(a); 
      var a = 'value2';
    })();


The following code will output ""my name is rex, Woof!"" and then ""my name is, Woof!"" one second later, fix it so prints correctly the second time
        
    var Dog = function (name) {
      this.name = name;
    };
    
    Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
      console.log('my name is '+ this.name + ', Woof!');
    }
    
    var rex = new Dog('rex');
    
    rex.bark();
    
    setTimeout(rex.bark, 1000);

The following code outputs 100, a hundred times, fix it so it outputs every number with a 100ms delay between each

    for (var i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
      }, 100);
    } 

The following code is outputting the array but it's filled with every number, we just want the even numbers, what's gone wrong?

    var evenNumbers = []
    
    var findEvenNumbers = function (i) {
      if (i % 2 === 0)
        console.log(i, 'is an even number, adding to array!');
        evenNumbers.push(i);
    }
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      findEvenNumbers(i);
    }
    
    console.log(evenNumbers);
    //outputs:
    //0 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //2 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //4 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //6 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //8 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

The following is outputting 0, but if 4^2 = 16 and 2^2 = 4 then the result should be 12

    var square = function (number) {
      result = number * number;
      return result;
    }
    
    result = square(4);
    result2 = square(2);
    difference = result - result2;
    
    console.log(difference);

* Write a function that when passed an array of numbers it gives you the max difference between the largest and smallest number **ONLY** if the small number is in front of the large number, not behind it, so for example: [3,4,8,1] = 5, notice how the biggest difference is between 8 and 1, but because the 1 is after the 8 in the array it shouldn't count, so really the biggest gap is the 3 and the 8.

* fizzbuzz (lol)

* I was presented with a html element with a border, and asked to animate it left to right full width of browser

* I was presented with another html box and asked to centre it both horizontally and vertically


Also, all these companies had me complete ""take home"" coding tests, they ranged from being really easy (simple ajax request to an api endpoint and populate some data on the page) to pretty in depth.

Hopefully anyone looking for new positions can use these as warmups/practice, it's important to not just know the answers, but really understand how things work and in the case of the challenges, why things are working the way they are.

Please consider supporting this project on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vasyop).

Also, it's clear that a lot of people would be interested to see this project completed, so spread the word (if you the ""reach"" to do so, as I am not a social media person).

**Edit:**

First of all thank you, and thank you to all the folks at /r/learnprogramming (I also posted there).

I highly appreciate your feedback and I have noted everything down.

I felt I got something right this time (some previous iterations [here](https://github.com/vasyop/mono) and [here](https://github.com/vasyop/mono2)), but I didn't expect this exactly. This was meant to be a portfolio pet project.

&#x200B;

It's clear to me now that this type of learning/programming tutorials are very much needed and I suspect not just for low level stuff, but also for more general programming topics as well.

&#x200B;

That being said, (""yup, here we go"") I am working full time and I also have my masters degree classes on weekends.

I very much enjoyed working on this project up until now, and it will get done for sure, seeing how well it was received.

&#x200B;

I want to devote as much time as I can to this project, so I quickly sketched up a patreon account.
