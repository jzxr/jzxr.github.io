0,For everyone who asks how to get better at R,jts115,https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/comments/jts115/for_everyone_who_asks_how_to_get_better_at_r/,"Often on this sub people ask something along the lines of ""How can I improve at R."" I remember thinking the same thing several years ago when I first picked it up, and so I thought I'd share a few resources that have made all the difference, and then one word of advice.

The first place I would start is reading [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham. Importantly, I would read each chapter carefully, inspect the code provided, and run it to clarify any misunderstandings. Then, what I did was do all of the exercises at the end of each chapter. Even just an hour each day on this, and I was able to finish the book in just a few months. The key here for me was never EVER copy and paste.

Next, I would go pick up [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz), again by Hadley Wickham. I don't necessarily think everyone needs to read every chapter of this book, but at least up through the S3 object system is useful for most people. Again, clarify the code when needed, and do exercises for at least those things which you don't feel you grasp intuitively yet.

Last, I pick up [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R\_inferno.pdf) by Pat Burns. This one is basically all of the minutia on how not to write inefficient or error-prone code. I think this one can be read more selectively.

The next thing I recommend is to pick a project, and do it. If you don't know how to use R-projects and Git, then this is the time to learn. If you can't come up with a project, the thing I've liked doing is programming things which already exist. This way, I have source code I can consult to ensure I have things working properly. Then, I would try to improve on the source-code in areas that I think need it. For me, this involved programming statistical models of some sort, but the key here is something that you're interested in learning how the programming actually works ""under the hood.""

Dove-tailed with this, reading source-code whenever possible is useful. In R-studio, you can use CTRL + LEFT CLICK on code that is in the editor to pull up its source code, or you can just visit [rdrr.io](https://rdrr.io).

I think that doing the above will help 80-90% of beginner to intermediate R-users to vastly improve their R fluency. There are other things that would help for sure, such as learning how to use parallel R, but understanding the base is a first step.

&#x200B;

And before anyone asks, I am not affiliated with Hadley in any way. I could only wish to meet the man, but unfortunately that seems unlikely. I simply find his books useful.",2020-11-14 16:22:26,2020,11,0.05548780487804877,Good,Not Nuetral

I am a big fan of compiling R resources. I stumbled across this really helpful website that I thought this community might find useful.

Perhaps mods might want to pin this post or a similar post where this community as a whole can keep track of all the incredible resources?

I have been compiling my own resource list, so feel free to use any of these as well.

16,"Does anyone actually ""get"" ggplot's ""Grammar of Graphics""?",en4y2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/comments/en4y2m/does_anyone_actually_get_ggplots_grammar_of/,"Not quite a rant. More a confession of incomprehension. ggplot is THE graphics package to use these days. One reason is supposed to be its basis in a ""grammar of graphics"", which provides an underlying logical structure. Well, maybe, but I'm damned if I can see it or use it to guide me.

For me ggplot is just a sequence of pretty arbitrary functions that produce nice plots. I mean, why ""aes""? It stands for ""aesthetics"" and mainly serves to define the data to use AFAIK. Why not call it ""setdata""?

What prompted this post was yesterday when I had a facetted bar plot and I wanted all the bars the same width (there were different numbers of bars in each facet and the default is equal width facets). So, off to Google. After several failures, I finally found that all I needed to do was include ""space = ""free"" in ""facet\_grid"". Try to tell me with a straight face that that is obvious and logical. The other ""near miss"" solutions were completely different.

In summary, ggplot is a great tool and you can find ways to do anything with it on Stack Overflow. Just don't tell me that there is some user-friendly logic to it.",2020-01-12 00:25:22,2020,1,0.14895833333333336,Good,Not Nuetral
17,Teachers: I made a script to combine zoom attendance reports,ld05ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/comments/ld05ya/teachers_i_made_a_script_to_combine_zoom/,"So, when you teach a class on zoom, you can download a CSV file for each class meeting. This is cool, because you don't have to spend  class time to take attendence, but it's far from perfect, because:

1. you have a different file for each class meeting,

2. every time someone joins or leaves a breakout room, it creates an extra row, so you have to aggregate the rows to see how many minutes someone was in class, and

3. The names aren't in alphabetical order.

This little program I made today solves these problems. Check it out:

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/comments/htj7up/r_resources/) a little while ago providing the learning resources I have compiled over the past 6 months while learning to program. They've been invaluable to me, especially during the early stages. My hope was to maybe have it become a sticky or sidebar post, but that never happened.

Since then I have updated the list and am hosting it on my blog for easier tracking. As I continue to learn, I plan on regularly updating the list, but please feel free to provide your resource suggestions here, as a comment in a disqus, or by email if you prefer.

35,How should you practice R when your daily job has no application of R?,jeho9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/comments/jeho9q/how_should_you_practice_r_when_your_daily_job_has/,"R newbie here [Edit 1: infact programming newbie; R is the first programming language I'm trying to learn]. I am trying to learn R out of my own interest and with an aspiration of growing in my career. However, my current job doesn't require R or any other programming/analytics for that matter. Therefore, I'm left with no opportunity to practice R with real world problems. For about a year now I have been trying to read books, learn from data camp, but I have almost never been able to apply and practice. So, the theoretical learning is not being enough so far as even for small problems I have to look up stack overflow or Google. My question is, how can I learn by doing provided I don't have any opportunity to apply R in my daily job?


[Edit 2]: looking at most of the responses, I felt my question does not provide enough information about the kind of job I have. I work 8-9 hours daily with my laptop. I work for pharma to conduct systematic reviews of clinical trials or observational studies. My job requires reading research papers, extracting useful data (both quantitative and text) from them, and writing reports. So, I use Excel, txt, CSV, doc files on a regular basis. I am aware of several R package developed for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analysis and I am working to learn and apply those. However, my greater interest is in developing R skills which has general applications, such as data cleaning/wrangling, indexing, using loop functions efficiently, writing my own functions, etc. I completely lack these abilities despite having basic understanding of these concepts. I few answers already provide solutions. However I felt providing more information might help you guys designing your answers better.

Using %>% you can chain together multiple functions to create pipelines for your data. That way you can write highly expressive code and mitigate the need to define intermediate variables for each step of you data processing. But how does %>% actually work? If you think about it, %>% does something quite astonishing: it applies the function on its right to the expression of its left. Achieving this is not really straightforward which is why I decided to write this post.

I have just recently created a YouTube channel on data analysis in R, with my recent videos so far being on visual analysis using ggplot2. I have spent the past 4 years using R and ggplot2, having used it while finishing my degree in Mathematics and Statistics. I currently work full time, and daily use R for visual analysis as well as statistical analysis. I have spent quite a bit of time making these videos, so I hope you can get something out of them.

80,Introduction to Analysis of Variance with R (ANOVA),fk0y8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/comments/fk0y8c/introduction_to_analysis_of_variance_with_r_anova/," 

When you want to buy a new commodity how can you test its quality and how can you understand its effectiveness amongst alternatives? People experience this common scenario, as most of the alternatives seem similar to each other. So, it becomes a challenge to choose the best one out of the collection. 

Here is a simple depiction to describe the situation. Suppose there are three medical procedures to cure patients with a similar ailment. But to choose the best one, you need to consider which one requires the least time to relieve patients. To make a certain and realistic decision, you need strong evidence that supports your strategy. This is the concept of Analysis Of Variance or ANOVA.  

**What is Analysis Of Variance?**

ANOVA is a mathematical approach to discover a trustworthy method by checking the means of two or more groups. It compares the patterns on the foundation of their means and depicts how different these patterns are to find out the most suitable outcome. 

You can use ANOVA to accept or reject if all the chosen procedures are equally effective or not when you accept something new. 

**One Way ANOVA**

**ANOVA** is a combination of numerous ideas and is used for manifold drives. As an effect, it is tough to express briefly or precisely.  It is used in a logistic retreat as well. Not only it calculates mean but also checks the diverse prototypical performance. F-Test is a process to compare the difference between the described variance and the unsolved variance. Here are a few examples to dive deep. 

A new study claims that music enhances the focus of the students in a class and so, helps them engross more information. But a teacher may distrust it. 

What if it disturbed the pupils in a damaging way? Or what type of tune would be a decent choice for this? It needs to have some proof to consider these issues. 

To understand it more clearly, you need to make small groups of students. Select students from three different classes. Now you have three different groups of ten indiscriminately selected pupils of the same age from different classrooms. The classroom environment is not the same. When classroom A has particular music, continuously playing in the background, classroom B has variable music playing in the classroom and classroom C has no music during the study. Using the technology of **Analysis Of Variance**, you can detect which one is helpful out of the three categories. 

**Two-way ANOVA**

Let’s take an instance of a situation, which has elements such as surveillance, gender, and dosage with 16 interpretations of each. They all must be mathematical and statistical as mean and variance are being used.

Here in gender, you have to alter into replica variable that includes assigning numbers like 1 and O for man and woman.  But LSS of variance can only be functional on measurable data.

ANOVA is a specific form of arithmetical theory test profoundly used in the study of test data.  A numerical assumption test is a technique of making an evaluation using data. The test result is called statistically noteworthy if it is considered improbable to have happened by chance, assuming the fact of the valueless hypothesis. A mathematically substantial result, when the p-value (probability) is less than a maximum level, justifies the denial of the worthless proposition but only if the earlier probability of the unimportant theory is not high.

Help me understand?",ddqqik,https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/comments/ddqqik/i_keep_having_to_look_up_whether_to_use_or_to/,"I guess they have to do with differences in the underlying data structure?

I have a similar problem when writing functions using dplyr and ggplot, sometimes you should use ""%>%"", sometimes ""+"", but I don't really understand what the difference is so I keep guessing. Can anyone shed some light on this?

However, I know nothing about how to produce code, specifically a Shiny web app, in a way that can be distributed to and used by others. Heck, *I don't even know what I don't know,* so googling leads to rabbit holes.

I'd like to learn some of the pro tips on R development. I've browsed through some good packages, but that doesn't really inform me of  the ""why"" associated with good practices.

I'm curious if anyone can share their favorite resources on the following:

\- Best practices for package development;

\- Best practices for Shiny web apps (hosting, common mistakes, common user issues);

\- Best practices for github for Shiny and packages;

\- Any neat tricks and tips you know with Shiny that make distribution of interactive plots more efficient and user friendly.

If you have an example git repo or some code that you think exemplifies good practice, I'd love to hear about it too!

So I have a [spreadsheet/csv of pitch data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asuauIfCfsaDuuS-iU02lqrPFLnoQ-FW/view?usp=sharing) that was exported from a baseball software and I'm trying to make a radar/clock chart using 2 columns. I have a [picture of what I want it to look](https://imgur.com/cWkir8i) like but can't figure out the code and I keep getting stuck.

&#x200B;

Some notes:

&#x200B;

1. the column ""spin\\\_dir"" is listed as time on a clock as hh:mm
2. spin\\\_eff is a percentage, 0-100
3. I need pitch\\\_type to be different colors from one another.

&#x200B;

As you can see in the example picture, a pitch is plotted on the clock based on spin\\\_dir.

&#x200B;

If a pitch has a higher spin\\\_eff, the plotted pitch goes farther away from the center.
