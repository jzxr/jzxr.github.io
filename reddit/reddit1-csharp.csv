7,So I had the strangest code interview,d6fepl,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/d6fepl/so_i_had_the_strangest_code_interview/,"So I just got back from code interview about 20 minutes ago and I am still not sure what happened.

I got there and I shook some hands, literally the first 15 seconds gave me a weird vibe, they looked at me as if they've never seen a person before.

The guy who interviewed me was the boss of the company, he did start off by showcasing the achievements they've accomplished the past 5 years and I was like wow that's really impressive, and then he showed me his personal office space and I told him, that's pretty snazzy looking.

&#x200B;

This is where the weird starts..

Now we're walking over to the table where we're going to have the interview, he pulls up his phone to grab my resume, he can't find it so I take the initiative to start asking questions regarding the position, such as, ""Oh I saw that you were looking for WPF developers, that's perfect because that's what I specialize in"" and he then tells me yeah we are looking for a few ones, and then he asks me ""What languages do you code in"" and I tell him, well there's a few, but I do mainly develop desktop applications using C#, and then he tell me, oh that's great.. But what programming language do you use? And I tell him.. Well.. C#, and then he proceeds to tell me, Well C# is just a framework, what language do you use? And I tell him.. Uhh.. Java? And then he says, Oh wow! That's great we were looking for some Java developers too.

&#x200B;

At this point you can only image how confused I look, not sure whether to stand up and scream ""REEEEEE"" or whether I should just stay and see where this goes.. Lucky for you guys I took the latter.

&#x200B;

So I stay and he starts asking me, do I know Linux and I was like yeah sure, and then he says great because we need someone who knows how to store backend data using SQL, and I was like.. What does that have to do with Linux, and he tells me, well that's what we store things in.

&#x200B;

Again.. Super confused face.

&#x200B;

He then proceeds to tell me that they have some inhouse work to do, that I can work part time and work on my own stuff on the side while working with their systems, I think I would be a solo developer there developing new systems using JavaScriot is what he mentioned and I do not feel ready for that, not even sure how to develop desktop apps using JavaScript lol, anyways I would do it, if it was for C# and WPF but as he clearly stated.. C# is not a programming language.  


He then texted me just now saying that I can start next week Wednesday..  
HELLO? Contract? Pay? Hours? Nothing? You just skipped a lot of steps mister.

&#x200B;

Anyways, figured I'd share this with you guys, I am still confused and I am not quite sure what happened, but I think I just landed a programming job developing Linux based SQL databases /s",2019-09-20 07:10:57,2019,9,0.16607289107289108,Good,Not Nuetral

18,Teaching my son to fall in love with code,axxtpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/axxtpq/teaching_my_son_to_fall_in_love_with_code/,"I was helping my son with his math homework last night. Nothing too complex. It was cash register style calculations like calculating sale prices, calculating sales tax on a product.

After finishing four of these types of problems my son speaks up:
""Dad? These math problems I'm showing are only for THIS question but the steps are always the same. How would I show this answer for all of these at the same time?""

I was reminded of a quote attributed to Bill Gates:
""I will always choose a lazy man to do a hard job because a lazy man will find an easy way to do it.""

So we pulled up Visual Studio and wrote our first C# console application together that would accept Initial Price, % Discount and Sales Tax rate and send the input to a method that would perform the calculations and output an array with all of the different prices to display in the console afterward.

He was hooked. He said: ""This is so much better than showing my work. This shows all the work for this type of problem forever. For the whole universe!"". Did I ever feel like a super hero.

We'd spent about 15 minutes going over the code together explaining how it all worked. He understood the console reads and writes but struggled to understand arrays. By the time we were done his math homework was long forgotten we had a helluva lot of fun writing code together.

When I tucked him in at bedtime he asked me if I could show him more again soon.

This is my rough draft so I'd be very grateful for any feedback you can offer!",a952u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/a952u3/introducing_redditnet_an_oauthbased_fullfeatured/,"There's a lot to cover so please forgive the long post.  I'll start with a brief overview of the project, then go into more detail from there.  Once I implement any feedback from you guys, we'll be ready for beta testing (and I'll be asking for your help with that, as well).  Should be able to put out a stable release shortly after that.

Incidentally, this post was created using the Reddit.NET library.

#Overview#

Reddit.NET is a .NET Core library that provides easy access to the Reddit API with virtually no boilerplate code required.  Keep reading below for code examples.

Currently, the library supports 169 of the 205 endpoints currently listed in the [API documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/).  All of them (except voting and admin-reporting, for obvious reasons) are covered by unit tests and all 327 of the tests are currently passing.  All of the most commonly used endpoints are supported.

Reddit.NET is FOSS (MIT license) and was written in C# by me over the last few months.  It will be available on NuGet once I'm ready to put out the first stable release, which I expect to be very soon.  You can check it out now on Github at:

**https://github.com/sirkris/Reddit.NET/tree/develop**

#Basic Architecture#

Reddit.NET follows a model-controller pattern, with each layer serving a distinct purpose.  The model classes/methods (which can be accessed directly if for some reason you don't want to go through the controller) handle all the REST interactions and deserializations.  The controller classes/methods organize these API features into a cleaner OO interface, with an emphasis on intuitive design and minimizing any need for messy boilerplate code.

##Models##

You'll notice that each model class corresponds to a section in the API documentation.  Each method represents one of those endpoints with their respective fields passed as method parameters.

Here's a list of the model classes:

* Account

* Captcha (unused, possibly deprecated; will probably remove it entirely before release)

* Emoji

* Flair

* LinksAndComments

* Listings

* LiveThreads

* Misc

* Moderation

* Modmail

* Multis

* PrivateMessages

* RedditGold (all untested so not currently supported)

* Search

* Subreddits

* Users

* Widgets

* Wiki

See https://github.com/sirkris/Reddit.NET/blob/develop/README.md for a list of all currently supported endpoints accessible via the models.

Since all the supported models can be accessed via one or more controllers, it is unlikely that you will ever need to call the models directly, at least in any production application.  But the option is there should the use case arise.

Ratelimit handling also occurs in the model layer.  If it's less than  a minute, the library will automatically wait the specified number of seconds then retry.  This can be easily tested using the LiveThread workflow tests.  If it's more than a minute, an exception will bubble up and it'll be up to the app developer to decide what to do with it.

Reddit.NET has a built-in limit of no more than 60 requests in any 1-minute period.  This is a safety net designed to keep us from inadvertantly violating the API speed limit.

JSON return data is automatically deserialized to its appropriate type.  All 170 of these custom types (and yes, it did take fucking forever to write them all) can be found in Models.Structures.

##Controllers##

These are the classes with which app developers will be doing all or most of their interactions.  While the models are structured to closely mirror the API documentation, the controllers are structured to create an intuitive, object-oriented interface with the API, so you'll notice I took a lot more liberties in this layer.

The controllers also provide other features, like asynchronous monitoring and automatic caching of certain data sets.  I'll get into that stuff in more detail below.

Each controller class corresponds to a Reddit object of some kind (subreddit, post, user, etc).  Here's a list of the controller classes:

* Account

 * Provides access to data and endpoints related to the authenticated user.

* Comment

 * Represents a Reddit comment and provides access to comment-related data and endpoints.

* Comments

 * Represents a set of comment replies to a post or comment.  Provides access to all sorts and monitoring.  Similar in purpose to SubredditPosts.

* Dispatch

 * This is a special controller that provides direct access to the models and keeps them in sync.

* Flairs

 * Provides access to data and endpoints related to a subreddit's flairs.

* LinkPost

 * Represents a Reddit link post and provides access to related data and endpoints.

* SelfPost

 * Represents a Reddit self post and provides access to related data and endpoints.

* Post

 * Base class for LinkPost and SelfPost.

* LiveThread

 * Represents a Reddit live event.  It provides access to related data, endpoints, and monitoring.

* Modmail

 * Provides access to data and endpoints related to the authenticated user's modmail.

* PrivateMessages

 * Provides access to data and endpoints related to the authenticated user's private messages.

* Subreddit

 * Represents a subreddit and provides access to related data and endpoints.

* SubredditPosts

 * Represents a set of a subreddit's posts.  Provides access to all sorts and monitoring.  Similar in purpose to Comments.

* User

 * Represents a Reddit user and provides access to related data and endpoints.

* Wiki

 * Represents a subreddit's wiki and provides access to related data and endpoints.

* WikiPage

 * Represents a wiki page and provides access to related data and endpoints.

Many controller methods also have async counterparts.

#Monitoring#

Reddit.NET allows for asynchronous, event-based monitoring of various things.  For example, if you're monitoring a subreddit for new posts, the monitoring thread will do its API query once every 1.5 seconds times the total number of current monitoring threads (more on that below).  When there's a change in the return data, the library identifies any posts that were added or removed since the last query and includes them in the eventargs.  The app developer can then write a custom callback function that will be called whenever the event fires, at which point the dev can do whatever they want with it from there.

Reddit.NET automatically scales the delay between each monitoring query depending on how many things are being monitored.  This ensures that the library will average 1 monitoring query every 1.5 seconds, regardless of how many things are being monitored at once, leaving 25% of available bandwidth remaining for any non-monitoring queries you wish to run.

There is theoretically no limit to how many things can be monitored at once, hardware and other considerations notwithstanding.  In one of the stress tests, I have it simultaneously montioring 60 posts for new comments.  In this case, the delay between each monitoring thread's query is 90 seconds (actually, it's 91.5 because it's also monitoring a subreddit for new posts at the same time).

If you want to see how much load this can handle, check out the PoliceState() stress test.  That one was especially fun to write.

Here's a list of things that can currently be monitored by Reddit.NET:

* Monitor a post for new comment replies (any sort).

* Monitor a comment for new comment replies (any sort).

* Monitor a live thread for new/removed updates.

* Monitor a live thread for new/removed contributors.

* Monitor a live thread for any configuration changes.

* Monitor the authenticated user's modmail for new messages (any sort).

* Monitor the authenticated user's modqueue for new items.

* Monitor the authenticated user's inbox for new messages.

* Monitor the authenticated user's unread queue for new messages.

* Monitor the authenticated user's sent messages for new messages.

* Monitor a subreddit for new posts (any sort).

* Monitor a subreddit's wiki for any added/removed pages.

* Monitor a wiki page for new revisions.

Each monitoring session occurs in its own thread.

#Solution Projects:#

There are 3 projects in the Reddit.NET solution:

* Example

 * A simple example console application that demonstrates some of Reddit.NET's functionality.  If you have Visual Studio 2017, you can run it using debug.  You'll need to set your application ID and refresh token in the debug arguments.  Only passive operations are demonstrated in this example app; nothing is created or modified in any way.

* Reddit.NET

 * The main library.  This is what the app dev includes in their project.

* Reddit.NETTests

 * This project contains unit, workflow, and stress tests using MSTest.  There are currently 327 tests, all passing (at least, they all pass for me).  All of the 169 supported endpoints are included in the tests, except for vote and admin-reporting endpoints.

#Running the Tests:#

Running the tests is easy.  All you need is an app ID and two refresh tokens (the second is used for things like accepting invitations and replying to messages).  The first refresh token should belong to a well-established account that wouldn't run into any special ratelimits or restrictions that might make certain endpoints unavailable.  The second refresh token's account does not have any special requirements, as it's only used in a handful of workflow tests.

You will also need to specify a test subreddit.  It should either be a non-existing subreddit (the tests will create it) or an existing subreddit in which the primary test user is a moderator with full privileges.  If you're going with a non-existing subreddit, you'll need to run the test that creates it first; there's a special playlist just for that and obviously you'll only need to do it that first time.  The same test subreddit should be reused on subsequent tests since there's no way to delete a subreddit once it's been created.

To set these values, simply edit the Reddit.NETTestsData.xml file.  Here's what it looks like:

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?>
    <Rows>
        <Row>
            <AppId>Your_App_ID</AppId>
            <RefreshToken>Primary_Test_User's_Token</RefreshToken>
            <RefreshToken2>Secondary_Test_User's_Token</RefreshToken2>
            <Subreddit>Your_Test_Subreddit</Subreddit>
        </Row>
    </Rows>

As you can see, it's pretty intuitive in terms of what goes where.  Once these values are set and you've created the test subreddit (either via the corresponding unit test or manually with the primary test user having full mod privs), you can run all the tests in any order and as many times as you want after that.

Many tests take less than a second to complete.  Others can take up to a few minutes, depending on what's being tested.  The workflow tests tend to take longer than the unit tests and the stress tests take longer than the workflow tests.  In fact, the stress tests take considerably longer; PoliceState() alone takes roughly 80 minutes to complete.

#Code Examples:#

    // Create a new Reddit.NET instance.
    var r = new RedditAPI(""MyAppID"", ""MyRefreshToken"");

    // Display the name and cake day of the authenticated user.
    Console.WriteLine(""Username: "" + r.Account.Me.Name);
    Console.WriteLine(""Cake Day: "" + r.Account.Me.Created.ToString(""D""));

    // Retrieve the authenticated user's recent post history.
    // Change ""new"" to ""newForced"" if you don't want older stickied profile posts to appear first.
    var postHistory = r.Account.Me.PostHistory(sort: ""new"");

    // Retrieve the authenticated user's recent comment history.
    var commentHistory = r.Account.Me.CommentHistory(sort: ""new"");

    // Create a new subreddit.
    var mySub = r.Subreddit(""MyNewSubreddit"", ""My subreddit's title"", ""Description"", ""Sidebar"").Create();

    // Get info on another subreddit.
    var askReddit = r.Subreddit(""AskReddit"").About();

    // Get the top post from a subreddit.
    var topPost = askReddit.Posts.Top[0];

    // Create a new self post.
    var mySelfPost = mySub.SelfPost(""Self Post Title"", ""Self post text."").Submit();

    // Create a new link post.
    // Use .Submit(resubmit: true) instead to force resubmission of duplicate links.
    var myLinkPost = mySub.LinkPost(""Link Post Title"", ""http://www.google.com"").Submit();  

    // Comment on a post.
    var myComment = myLinkPost.Reply(""This is my comment."");

    // Reply to a comment.
    var myCommentReply = myComment.Reply(""This is my comment reply."");

    // Create a new subreddit, then create a new link post on said subreddit,
    // then comment on said post, then reply to said comment, then delete said comment reply.
    // Because I said so.
    r.Subreddit(""MySub"", ""Title"", ""Desc"", ""Sidebar"")
    .Create()
    .SelfPost(""MyPost"")
    .Submit()
    .Reply(""My comment."")

#How You Can Help#

At the moment, what I need more than anything is a fresh pair of eyes (preferably several).  This project has grown rather large, so I imagine there are all kinds of little things here and there that could be improved upon.  Please don't be afraid to speak-up!  The feedback you give me will enable me to fix anything I might've missed, plan new features, etc.

Code reviews would be helpful at this stage.  I've been a software engineer for just about 25 years now, though I'm still wading into modern C# and .NET Core in particular, so there may be available optimizations/etc that I'm simply not aware of.  This will be our opportunity to catch any of those.

Once I've implemented any recommendations made here, we'll proceed to beta testing.  That will be when I'll be needing people to help by running the tests and posting the results.  You can do that now, if you like; they should all pass.  Though I'm not seeking beta testers yet, if you do run the tests anyway, please post your results here!  So far, I'm the only one who has tested this.

I'm sure there's probably more that I'm forgetting to mention, but I think I've covered all the major points.  I'll of course be happy to answer any questions you might have, as well.  Thanks for reading!

Try to  find where the Faker class is defined in the project and realize its not  there.. look to the usings section for a package reference that seems  out of the ordinary. ""using Bogus;"" immediately jumps out as an odd one.  Open the google machine to find docs for the package. Find the public  repo for the project. Realize its a package with the power to generate  bogus test data for anything you wanna map it to. One object? No  problem. A collection of objects? No sweat. You want to generate an  angry comment on the fly? It can do that too. It can do lots of stuff.  Stuff I would never need it to do, but I might just make it do it  because its cool as hell.

My  entire career.. Ive been a chump manually declaring test objects and  dummy data. Dont be like me. Dont just accept the shit fate that is  manually populating dummy data for your demos and test plans. Realize  that Bogus is a thing.

This is probably nothing to most of the people on here, but I did it!

What did I do?

I taught myself enough C# over the semester to pass the final project in my computer architecture where we had to simulate a Batcher Banyan network.

For those who don't know, that's a network that sorts packets to their destinations based upon their binary values.

The batcher portion creates a certain number of packets, and the banyan portion determines what their destinations are based upon switches.

This is significant because it's a computer science project that requires programming in a class that didn't state it had a programming requirement. Between u/bobtabor's MSDN videos, Stack Overflow, and a helpful user here who suggested the String.PadLeft method, I was able to write this simple software based on a diagram and nothing else.

No source code to start with...no example programs already in use.

I literally created my first full program without a tutorial and I'm so freaking happy!

Now I'm going to spend my winter break going over Bob's videos on his website (the C# videos that actually use the forms) since the MSDN channel 9 files are missing.

I've crossed that threshold, and I'm finally EXCITED about something in computer science!

I would post the code here, but the class is still open. I can however post a link to my video, which shouldn't give too much away in terms of the code itself.
