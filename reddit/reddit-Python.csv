It then closes and opens Spotify by the os module and plays it via pynput.

There have been a few programs in this subreddit which offer a similar functionality but mute spotify, and play another locally-stored song. I preferred not using that method and hence did this.

The code is present below, and is also present in my github repo [here](https://github.com/SakDev/SpotiByeBye).

Once again, I truly would appreciate any constructive feedback!

**Edit**: Thank you so much for your positive response!!!! I've added a readme file to help anyone understand the gist of setting up the Spotify API to get your Client ID and secret.

~~And to all the people who claim this is stealing, I just wanted to say that while it does test ethical bounds, this program merely restarts Spotify using legally-obtained data from Spotify.~~
