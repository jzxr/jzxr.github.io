23,[RANT] Anybody else against CSS frameworks in general?,dyn86t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/dyn86t/rant_anybody_else_against_css_frameworks_in/," 

Especially Bootstrap, but even if it's as tight as Bulma ([https://bulma.io/](https://bulma.io/))  -- it's still violating the core principle of keeping ones HTML  semantic and not mixing it with anything style-related. Tears me up  seeing these YouTube-tuts where their HTML slowly but surely gets more  and more messy with tons of ugly classes and a Matryoshka doll type div  setup (container inside container inside container etc.).

The  same goes for grids - what's the point of that? Having ones RHTML/CSS  responsive is one thing, but grids? For Pete's sake. I've studied  architecture at university and using grids there, or in typography or  graphic design is an absolutely vital concept. But transferring that to  ones RHTML/CSS for some reason I've yet to figure out, makes me puke a  little bit in my mouth. But I guess I can just wash it back down with my  tears from those YouTube-tuts :)

Having  said that, I agree with the Bulma author's reasoning that creating your  own HTML/CSS requires time, effort and the ability to make things  beautiful. But on the other hand, if you want something right, you gotta  do it yourself. And there's no doubt that one day the CSS framework you  currently use will be outdated and something prettier and simpler will  be available. Unless, ofcourse, you made the CSS yourself pretty to  begin with, and the HTML semantic without any visual involvement  whatsoever.

35,3 things that could help Junior Developers to stand out during an interview (besides coding):,kzwvpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/kzwvpk/3_things_that_could_help_junior_developers_to/," 

1. Work on projects using version control: In professional settings, we use a version control system like git. It allows us to work on new features/code, whiteout touching the codebase. It means we have a master branch that contains production-ready code and you would branch out to work on a new feature. Let's say you need to implement a new button, you would branch out from master to write new code that would display a button. Once you are done writing the code, you would merge the code back to master, after it passed all the tests. So take a look at GitHub or GitLab and get familiar with basic commands like push, pull, merge, and commit. 
2. Have a basic understanding of agile development: There is a certain prosses set in place that helps companies to deliver software for their customers. In software development, we have a number of steps before the code can be released. We have a set of Requirements, Design, Development, Testing (Design, Development, and Testing is repeated till testing has been satisfied), and only after you can Deploy. This is something you probably can't really practice by yourself. But knowing this could increase your chances of getting a junior position.
3. Start getting familiar with task management tool(s): When you will be working with a team, you will have visibility on what your team is currently working on, what's been done, and what is coming up. Each task is assigned to one team member. Let's say you are working on a task and suddenly, you need to clarify if a JSON will contain a specific key:value pair. You could use a task management tool to find out who is working on that ticket, so you don't need to bother the entire team to answer your question. Overall it helps to get things done faster. So for practice, try to use some task management tool like Jira or Trello and separate your work into its appropriate tasks.

These are my top 3 pieces of advice that could help junior developers to stand out during the interview process. Sometimes it's not enough to rely only on the technical side especially when you are just starting out and still developing your skills.

40,4 Things I wish I knew when I started writing HTML & CSS [x-post from r/tiwikwis],5nnj8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/5nnj8i/4_things_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_started_writing/,"I've been doing front-end design and development professionally for 10+ years, so many of these techniques wouldn't have applied when I *first* started, but goddamn I wish I'd picked them up sooner.

##1. Always look for new shortcuts for your workflow

Automation can breed laziness, but the time savings almost always offset the costs of any bad habits.

Some fantastic tools that I wish I'd learned to use sooner:

**[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)** - automate all those tedious deployment tasks, like prefixing CSS, minifying scripts, and hundreds of other things that you can scratch off your manual task list.

**[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)** (or LESS) - An extension language for CSS, I resisted this for far too long out of laziness. It's amazing. Write better, more robust CSS with much less typing.

**[Emmet](http://emmet.io/)** - again, I could have saved hundreds of thousands of keystrokes with this text-expansion plugin.

Type in something like this:

    div>ul#demolist>(li.ex)*3

hit TAB, and Emmet expands it to this:

    <div>
    	<ul id=""demolist"">
    		<li class=""ex""></li>
    		<li class=""ex""></li>
    		<li class=""ex""></li>
    	</ul>
    </div>

Emmet works with some of the fancier text editors, which brings me to...

##2. Learn to use a fancy text editor

I used Notepad++ for almost 7 years, well after other, more feature-filled text editors had hit the market.

Notepad++ will always have a place in my heart, but after switching to **[Brackets](http://brackets.io/)**, I've never looked back. It's an absolute delight to work with, and makes writing HTML and CSS much, much easier. (SublimeText is sexy as well)

##3. Set up a local development server

This deviates a bit from HTML & CSS, but PHP does have considerable overlap with some of my projects - like Wordpress themes.

For a long, long time, I only worked with PHP on remote servers. 

That meant opening every file I wanted to edit directly from the FTP client, saving the changes, uploading back to the server, and checking in the browser.

In retrospect, that was ridiculous.

Setting up **[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)** always seemed a little daunting to me, but again: once it went up, I never looked back.

It's so, so, so much easier to work with PHP files and databases locally. Not to mention safer.

##4. Find a framework. Learn it, extend it, love it.

My first experience with frameworks was with Bootstrap, way back when it first came out. I wasn't using SASS or LESS at the time, so it was a real pain in the ass to customize. I liked the idea, but it wasn't for me.

Then, in 2013, I had a massive Wordpress theme to build, and I absolutely needed a responsive front-end framework.

After weighing some options, I decided on **[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)**.

There was a slight learning curve, and the first setup took me a whole day, but I've used it for every project since then.

I've also found myself adding new helper classes to the framework - classes that I carry over to every project.

It's almost comforting to know that the ""mb0"" class will force the margin-bottom attribute on an element to zero.

Or that the ""pt12"" css will set the top-padding  to 48px.

Sure, it's sloppy, but when I'm marking up 9,000-word sales pages for a quick A/B test, every little bit helps.

51,What advice would I give to new Junior Developers.,kqpt4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/kqpt4b/what_advice_would_i_give_to_new_junior_developers/,"1. You don't need to know everything when you starting out:
   1. One of the things that I remember when I was a Junior Developer. I thought I had to know everything. But in reality, the expectation was how fast can I learn and can I work together with a team. Because when you are starting out, your seniors or supervisor will know that you are no expert and they would be giving you easy tasks that they know you can handle and learn from bit by bit. So don't forget, when you are starting out, focus on sharpening your skills and be a team member.
2. Learn how to break code apart:
   1. One of the major things in writing code is to learn how can you make it reusable. It sounds easy, but it's a bit tricky in practice. One of the books that I would recommend (I read it as a junior and it helped me to jump-start my career) and is to read clean code written by  Robert Cecil Martin. 
3. Last but not least, try to reference the docs:
   1. A lot of developers (who aren't even juniors) would search StackOverflow for the answer instead of going directly to the source. Copying and pasting the answer is not how you will get to the answer. Most of the time StackOverflow would have answers that are not best in practice. So when you write a new piece of code lest say using JavaScript, refer to the JavaScript document on how the specific function is working.  


These are my top 3 pieces of advice to Juniors that helped me to progress in the tech world much faster and I hope that this will help you to advance your technical skills much faster as well.

The items between <!-- --> are comments inserted in the program to aid in the understanding of the code, therefore they explain the purpose of each section.

`<!-- defines the type of document -->`

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

`<html lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">`

  `<head>`

`<meta charset=""utf-8"">`

`<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">`

`<meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""ie=edge"">`

`<title>Mac&Cheese Recipe</title>`

  `</head>`

  `<!-- This section marks the beginning of the code that the user sees -->`

  `<body>`

`<!-- Two headers of different sizes -->`

`<h1>Simple Macaroni and Cheese Recipe</h1>`

`<h3>Quick and easy fix to a tasty side dish.</h3>`

`<!-- a paragraph to separate the text from the image, this is used through the page to separate things -->`

`<p>  </p>`

`<!-- inserts an image of the recipe in question -->`

`<img src=""./images/mac-and-cheese.jpg"" alt="""">`

`<p></p>`

`<!-- another text formatted as header to introduce to the following unordered list -->`

`<h2>Ingredients</h2>`

`<p></p>`

`<!-- this marks the beginning of the unordered list -->`

`<ul>`

`<li>1 (8 once) box elbow macaroni</li>`

`<li>1/4 cup butter</li>`

`<li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>`

`<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>`

`<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>`

`<li>2 cups milk</li>`

`<li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>`

`</ul>`

`<!-- end of unordered list -->`

`<p></p>`

`<!-- another text formatted as header to introduce the following ordered list -->`

`<h2>Directions</h2>`

`<p></p>`

`<!-- this marks the beginning of the ordered list -->`

`<ol>`

`<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>`

`<li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>`

`<li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.</li>`

While we want to keep the community as open as possible, we would like to ask that you try to only post questions which have an answer.

What this means is that a question like ""I want my website to let users sign up and post stuff, like Facebook. How do I do this with HTML?"" are not really suited due to the huge scope of the question. We won't remove these questions, however we do discourage them.

I would also like to take this time to clarify what HTML is. HTML is a markup language. This means that it is used for static pages or content. Below is a list of some frequently asked things which HTML cannot do:

* Let users login/register
* Connect to a database or anything related
* Write to a file
* Save things anywhere

All of those things, and lots more, must be done server side. This means with a language like PHP (/r/php) or Node.js (/r/nodejs). HTML cannot do any of those things. Please ask yourself if your question falls under any of those categories before posting it.

Thanks!

98,Job offers and developers,kac6hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/kac6hw/job_offers_and_developers/,"Hi!,

I found out that it is really hard to find a good discord server where I can find job offers or post an offer for developers... Because of that I decided to create a new discord server only for that. I would like to create a nice, friendly community to help each other finding new projects or developers to develop new incredible things! I would like to invite you there, here is a link [https://disboard.org/server/785944707582656513](https://disboard.org/pl/server/785944707582656513) I am also looking for mods and people that would like to help me to grow it so please feel free to write to me and ask for joining our admins!

Kind regards",2020-12-11 01:06:52,2020,12,0.2974941724941725,Good,Not Nuetral
99,is there any difference between just using <a> and styling it like a button or using <button>?,jifsvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/jifsvn/is_there_any_difference_between_just_using_a_and/,"Hi

In some courses I have seen the instructor using just an <a> tag and with CSS making it look like a button without using a <button> tag. Is there any advance/disadvantage to this?
